Create a section that displays the products with their names, prices and images using HTML/CSS only (no JavaScript). Each product should have its own row in an unordered list (`<ul>`), where each item represents one product. The name of the jewelry piece will be inside `<h3>`, price within a paragraph tag(`<p>`), and image with class "product-image" displayed using inline CSS styling (no external stylesheets).

Answer: To display products in an unordered list, you can add another section under the `body` element. Here's how to structure it using HTML/CSS only:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Handmade Jewelry Store</
